## Dea

These are Deas changes. This is a chunk of code.

```{r}
1+1
```

### New feature

This is Deas new feature
```{r}
2+2
```


### Helene

```{r}
a <- 2
b <- 4
a+b
```

This is simple maths.
#### New feature
```{r}
print("This is a new feature")
```

### Johanne

Here is some random code:

```{r}
print("Today is Tuesday!")
```

#### New feature

Let do some more random code:

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
```

Let see if x and y is correlated:

```{r}
cor(x, y)
```

Nope, not really.
