### Dea
These are Deas changes
```{r}
1+1
```



### Helene
```{r}
a <- 2
b <- 4
a+b
```
This is simple maths.

### Johanne

Here is some random code:

```{r}
print("Today is Tuesday!")
```

#### New feature

Let do some more random code:

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
```

Let see if x and y is correlated:

```{r}
cor(x, y)
```

Nope, not really.
